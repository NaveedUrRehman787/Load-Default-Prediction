## Introduction

In this project, we tackle the task of Load Default Prediction using machine learning techniques. Predicting load default is crucial for various financial institutions to assess the risk associated with extending loans. The main goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a load default based on various features.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about historical loan data including features such as customer demographics, loan details, and repayment history. Due to confidentiality reasons, the dataset cannot be provided in this repository. However, a sample dataset or a similar dataset can be used for testing and development purposes.
## Model

We utilized the Random Forest algorithm for load default prediction. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It offers high accuracy and robustness against overfitting.
## Usage

To use the code provided in this repository:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. (See requirements.txt)
    Load your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
    Run the training script to train the Random Forest model.
    Evaluate the model using evaluation metrics such as ROC score.
    Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved an ROC score of 72% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting loan defaults. Further analysis and optimization can be performed to improve the model's performance.
